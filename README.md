This is a fork of [gdx-ai](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai) updated to depend on [mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx) instead of [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

### Usage

The version number will always correspond to the mini2Dx version that the framework requires. 

__Gradle__

```
compile "org.mini2Dx:gdx-ai:2.0.0-alpha.34"
```

### License

The gdxAI project is licensed under the [Apache 2 License](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/blob/master/LICENSE), meaning you
can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects.
